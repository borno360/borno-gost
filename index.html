        <h5 class="card-title" >1.Haunted House of Dhanmondi 27 in Dhaka City</h5>
        <div class="card-text">
        <p >An apartment in Dhanmondi 27 seems haunted by an evil power. In Dhaka city, there may be many other haunted houses and apartments. But, This one is famous. Let’s go through this article to know about the history and details about that spooky flat.</p>
          <br>
              <p>Like other residential areas of Dhaka city, Dhanmondi is densely populated. It is very rare to find any vacant house. One will find an empty apartment, at the end of road 27, closely near to OXFORD School, in front of Bangladesh Eye hospital. The third floor of the building remains vacant for more than 10 years. Locals say this house became haunted after the suicide of a woman inside the apartment. Although apartment rates are high in this area, no tenants brave enough to stay at this apartment at a cheaper rate. People, who want to stay in this apartment, must face some unusual experiences. It may be physical & psychological. One may identify the building by observing Arabic writing in front of the gate unlike other buildings. The mystery is that tenants are eager to the very up or down floor, but no tenants are able to stay in the third floor.</p>
           
              <br>
              <p>One may identify the haunted floor by looking simply its poor outlook. There is no painting or sun-protected glass in the corridor. Grills are rusted. Unlike other floors, there is no sign of life.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Locals believe that unsatisfied souls stay there. Authority doesn’t allow anyone to enter or take photos inside the floor. They believe it may cause any disturbance to the soul(s).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Rumors flew for years and years about the existence of evil spirit at the Haunted house of Dhanmondi 27. Some say those rumors are not true. But, We have found significant numbers of witnesses who have claimed that this place is haunted. One of the construction workers of the building once quoted that there had been some unusual activities like fall of bricks from nowhere. Some other people have said about the sudden load shedding and noise of screaming from the roof and higher floors of the building. But nothing of these had been visualized yet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Most of those people who claim that there are ghosts in this house, only give their opinion based on what they heard from other people, Rumor in other word. So until this is a proved scenario, nobody can actually prove the presence of any evil cursed being in this house.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As there are people who claimed to be the witnesses of paranormal activity in Dhanmondi 27, we may want to believe what they say. But, We can’t be sure until there is any clear proof.

Whatever the truth is not a matter. The apartment of Dhanmondi 27 has been carrying some spooky stories for years. Those are enough to give you goosebumps when you are alone in a dark apartment.
